## Introduction  
In this project, I've conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Coursera dataset, using Jupyter Notebooks exclusively. During the project I've practiced and learned some libraries like Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib and Seaborn.  

## Context  
This dataset contains information about the courses offered in the educational platform Coursera. By analyzing the data provided I intend to find trends that might be helpful for Coursera, and for the organizations offering courses in this platform.  

## Process
Coming soon!
