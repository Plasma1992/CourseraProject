## Context  
This dataset contains information about the courses offered in the educational platform Coursera. By analyzing the data provided I intend to find trends that might be helpful for Coursera, and for the organizations offering courses in this platform.  

## Introduction  
In this project, I've conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Coursera dataset, using Jupyter Notebooks exclusively. During the project I've practiced and learned some libraries like Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib and Seaborn. You can access the full report <a href="https://github.com/Plasma1992/CourseraProject/blob/main/Report%20project_coursera.ipynb">here</a>.  
You can also scroll down to the bottom to find the key insights.
